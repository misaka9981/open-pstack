# Upstream synchronization

open-pstack tracks [Cursor's pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) while adapting Cursor-specific primitives for Claude Code, Codex, and Pi.

## Current sync point

| Source | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | `https://github.com/cursor/plugins.git` |
| Path | `pstack/` |
| Commit | `23e4138daa01c42d4969f7a5465f82704e64f798` |
| Upstream version | `0.15.6` |
| open-pstack version | `1.6.0` |

The table above is the current Cursor sync point. Open Pstack 1.6.0 imports this 0.15.6 sync. `README-UPSTREAM.md` preserves the upstream pstack README verbatim. `CHANGES.md` and `NOTICE.md` describe the adaptations and provenance.

## Upstream-only exclusions

- Commits `799151d` and `6fecddb` add and relocate `make-bot-ui`. It depends on Cursor routines, webhook events, and UI primitives that Claude Code and Codex do not share.
- Four `disable-model-invocation: true` lines from `73f8be4` are not applied to `how`, `why`, `unslop`, or `typescript-best-practices`. Poteto-mode invokes those skills by name, and the flag blocks that route on Claude Code. For the same reason, `benchmark-checklist` from `23e4138` ships without the flag. The new `principle-explain-the-number` leaf takes `user-invocable: false` like the other principle leaves.
- The `23a56e2` Fable defaults for `bug-fix`, `perf-issue`, and `hillclimb` were never applied. `889ec4b` and `70b2dc8` superseded them with Grok, and Open Pstack now follows that default.
- The Sol family runs `gpt-6.1-sol` instead of upstream's `gpt-5.6-sol` (`gpt-5.6-sol-max`). The maintainer chose the newer model, and it is the Codex model the magpie relay exposes to Pi (#21).
- The Grok 4.7 slug from `70b2dc8` is not applied. The Grok route keeps `grok:grok-4.6` until a maintainer with the Grok CLI probes `grok-4.7` through the runner.
- `70b2dc8` shrinks the default panels to Opus 5.5, Sol, and Grok. Open Pstack moves judgment roles to `claude:opus@max` but keeps Fable as the fourth panel lane, so the panel default stays the model-matrix quad.
- The `70b2dc8` and `12d587d` lines that rerun a rejected model on its family default or the closest valid slug are not applied. They conflict with the no-fallback contract in `provider-dispatch.md`.
- The `23e4138` built-in PR tool rule is not applied. Claude Code, Codex, and Pi have no built-in PR tool, so Opening a PR and the plan skeleton keep the resolved forge CLI.
- The Claude manifest does not take the logo field from `efa2a53` because Claude Code has no schema for it. The shared asset is exposed through the Codex manifest instead.

## Check for changes

The repository already names Cursor's repository as the `cursor` remote in the maintainer checkout. A fresh clone can add it once:

```shell
git remote add cursor https://github.com/cursor/plugins.git
```

Fetch and inspect only commits that touched pstack after the recorded sync point:

```shell
git fetch cursor main
git log --oneline 23e4138daa01c42d4969f7a5465f82704e64f798..cursor/main -- pstack
git diff --stat 23e4138daa01c42d4969f7a5465f82704e64f798..cursor/main -- pstack
```

No output means the tracked pstack tree has not changed. This comparison does not need a polling service or generated mirror branch.

## Incorporate a change

1. Create or update a GitHub issue in `ericlitman/open-pstack` and branch from current `main`.
2. Read each upstream pstack commit in order. Bring over its intent and content, then apply only the Claude Code, Codex, and Pi substitutions documented in `CHANGES.md`.
3. Keep one shared `plugins/pstack/skills/` tree. Put harness translation in the existing `codex-tools.md` and `pi-tools.md` and provider routing in `provider-dispatch.md`; do not fork a skill per harness.
4. Update the commit and version in this file, the affected provenance rows in `NOTICE.md`, and `README-UPSTREAM.md` when upstream changes it.
5. Run CI-equivalent checks locally, then run the installed Claude Code, Codex, and Pi behavioral lanes required by the changed surface. Unit tests alone are not a release gate.
6. Merge the reviewed PR before tagging the next open-pstack release.

Cursor's version and open-pstack's version are independent. Cursor's version identifies the imported content; open-pstack's version identifies the cross-harness distribution.
