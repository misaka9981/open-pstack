# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

**Dispatch contract.** Resolve every configured role through [`provider-dispatch.md`](../poteto-mode/references/provider-dispatch.md). Values are provider-qualified descriptors; the parent chooses native versus external execution. On Codex or Pi, resolve remaining Claude tool names via [`codex-tools.md`](../poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md) or [`pi-tools.md`](../poteto-mode/references/pi-tools.md).

Every spawn is a `read-only` lane. Explorers use the `how explorer` line from the current harness's pstack model sheet (default `grok:grok-4.6@xhigh`), and every explainer uses the `how explainer` line (default `claude:opus@xhigh`). A native lane uses the parent subagent primitive; an external lane uses the launcher directly.

## 1. Assess complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): no explorers. Dispatch one explainer that explores and explains in one pass, built from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer-findings section. Go to step 4.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): go to step 2.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

## 2. Explore (complex only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 angles, each a distinct slice of the subsystem. Start all explorers in one fan-out phase, each with `references/explorer-prompt.md` and its angle filled in.

## 3. Synthesize (complex only)

Once all explorers have returned, dispatch one explainer with `references/explainer-prompt.md` and every explorer's findings filled in.

## 4. Present

Present the explainer's output. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.
